# Syllabification-for-Uyghur-Python
Syllabification is an essential step for many NLP tasks. I build this simple python-based syllibification code for [my text-to-speech program](https://github.com/neouyghur/uyghur-text-to-speech). This code is inspired from the another github repository [Syllabification for Uyghur][2], which is written according to the paper [A Syllabification Algorithm and Syllable Statistics of  Written Uyghur][1] in Java.

# Introduction
UyghurSyllabification.py includes the syllabification class for Uyghur script.
